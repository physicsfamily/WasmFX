# WasmFX: High-Performance Image Effects for the Web



WasmFX is an open-source library that brings high-speed, desktop-grade image processing directly to the web browser. It leverages the power of **Rust** compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)** to execute complex pixel manipulations at near-native speeds.

This project's main goal is to serve as a high-quality educational resource. It provides a complete, end-to-end example of how to build, test, and integrate a high-performance Rust library with a modern front-end framework (Angular) using a professional monorepo setup.

### ✨ Features

* **Blazing Fast:** Performs complex pixel-by-pixel filter operations in milliseconds.
* **Client-Side & Secure:** All processing happens 100% in the browser. No images are ever uploaded to a server, ensuring total user privacy.
* **Educational:** Provides a clear, well-commented codebase for both the Rust `wasm_lib` and the Angular `demo_site`.
* **Modern Workflow:** Uses `wasm-pack` to bridge the gap between Rust and the NPM/TypeScript ecosystem seamlessly.

### Project Goal

This project is built based on the step-by-step plan in the **[Rust + WASM Image Processing Library Plan](rust_wasm_image_project_plan.md)**. It is designed to be a "living document" and a starting point for anyone interested in using Rust to supercharge their web applications.
